// Package blueprint provides functionality for partitioning, encapsulating,
// and extending route groups in flotilla applications. Two interfaces are
// detailed: Blueprint and Blueprints.  Blueprints is the meta interface used
// to gather and manage multiple Blueprints by a flotilla application while the
// Blueprint interface is the base interface to gather multiple routes into a
// single grouping that may be built and managed separately, as well as shared
// across multiple applications.
